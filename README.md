# netgraph
Some rust code to extract all links from a given webpage, to a given level of complexity.

For example running `netgraph.exe -l 3 https://github.com/mrhooray/kdtree-rs` will yeild a result of around 20 webpages

**Warning** This code likely doesn't work, and I'm unlikely to fix it in the future.
